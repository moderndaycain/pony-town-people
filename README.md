if you see my skins without the github link ask them my favorite song

if it's not one from a band i listen to they're not me <3

i have a pretty "emo" taste in music and it's quite distinct

if i'm feeling like dogwater i'll use a weird faceless cat skin. you know the one.

i like horror media and the like, as well as animal survival games!
